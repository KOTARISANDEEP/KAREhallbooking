# Assets Folder

This folder contains static assets for the KARE Hall Booking System.

## Owner Image

To add the college owner's image:

1. **File Name**: Save your image as `owner.png`
2. **Location**: Place it in this folder (`project/frontend/src/assets/owner.png`)
3. **Recommended Size**: 100x100px or 200x200px for best quality
4. **Format**: PNG format is recommended for transparency support
5. **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) works best for the circular display

## Current Status

- ✅ Placeholder file created: `owner.png`
- ✅ Fallback SVG icon implemented
- ✅ Responsive sizing (10x10 on mobile, 12x12 on desktop)
- ✅ Rounded circular display with border
- ✅ Error handling for missing image

## Usage

The owner image is automatically displayed in the center of the navbar on:
- Home page
- Login page  
- Register page

If the image file is missing, a default user icon will be displayed instead.
